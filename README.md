# EDA-Project-One-Group-6
First Project of EDA 

My part of the project was to collect data for different age groups among immigrants, non-immigrants, and non-permanent residents

Data Collection: After reviewing the data in the csv file. I started cleaning it up by removing first the NaN values and removing irrelevant columns. Cleaned up the columns names to make it more readable 
After that i grouped all the ages available in the data, and grouped them by regions as well focusing on Ontario


Data Analysis: Calculated the different age groups by immigrants, non-immigrants, and non-permanent residents. Also, filtered the data further to calculate the same data within toronto 

Data Visualization: To visualize the data I used bar charts for immigrants, non-immigrants, and non-permanent residents in ontario and toronto
.

The most significant age group was 15 years and older, more specifically the 25 to 65 group. Most of the numbers coming out of the Toronto region 
I did an analysis on the Ottawa region as well and found out that the age groups remain the same as in Toronto.
