**Summary**

The objective of this project is to analyze demographic data related to age, gender, region and year of immigrant status in Canada. The dataset used for this analysis is derived from the 2021 Counts statistics, which provide information on the population distribution across various age groups, genders, and immigrant categories. 

The project focuses on understanding the composition of the Canadian population based on age, gender, and immigration characteristics. It aims to provide insights into the distribution of the population in different age groups, gender categories, and immigrant statuses, including non-immigrants, immigrants, and non-permanent residents. 

The analysis will involve examining the data at provincial levels. The geographic breakdown includes Ontario as a whole and its individual areas. The provinces which we have considered in this study is Ontario.
